//so this script reads midi files for a battle, and then loads the song position data into a list of times for hits to happen
//the battles are going to be contained in one midi file, so no need for loops or anything, assume the track is all hand made

//gonna just read from a text file that the midi parser writes to 
//well 

//actually lets just re-setup iron python it shouldnt be too bad and will save jerry alot of headaches


public class MidiLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {

    }
}
